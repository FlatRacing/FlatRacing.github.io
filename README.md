## Game Instructions

Use your arrow keys to drive your ship. The aim of the game is to increase your score without bumping into the tunnel and the meteors. The more you drive on the right of the screen, the more you increase your score.

In the 2 players mode, if the countdown terminates before none of the players dies, then the winner is the player with the highest score. Feel free to bump into the other player’s ship to make him die!
